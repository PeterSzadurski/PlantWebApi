## Installation

Clone the repository or download & extract the zip.

## General Information

This assessment does not use any database software, all data is stored inside a .json file.  
Make sure to run the web service before the frontend

## Running The Web Service

The backend web service was made using **Visual Studio 2019**, other versions would probably work.  
Open the **Backend** folder in and run **Backend.sln** in Visual Studio.  
The web service will start in port 57804.

## Running The Front End

Open the **frontend** folder with your ide of choice, I used **Visual Studio Code**.  
Open the terminal and run the command:
```
npm install
```
After a few minutes, the installation should finish, now run the command:
```
npm start
```
The frontend should start on port 3000.
